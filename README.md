# Diabetes-Prediction
This project aims to assist in early diagnosis using features like glucose levels, BMI, age, and more. It implements a machine learning pipeline to predict diabetes using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on health-related tabular data

**Model:**

We use Support Vector Machine (SVM) with optional kernel tuning (linear) and feature scaling via StandardScaler.

1. Preprocessing Steps
2. Handle missing or zero values
3. Feature scaling
4. Train-test split
5. Model Training
6. Model Evaluation
